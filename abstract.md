# Throw me the Idol

Finding yourself in a situation where you need to make sense of, and maybe maintain, someone else's code is often said to be like gardening or, in extreme cases, archaeology. The code needn't been an old legacy system filled with ancient secrets and artefacts, it could be the newest piece of JavaScript framework wonderousness from another team or a proof-of-concept idea you now have to make production ready. 

If you have ever found yourself Indiana-Jonesing it through this kind of codebase what strategies and techniques can you use to stay ahead of the boulders and out of the clutches of the Nazis?

I have inherited more than my fair share of codebases through my career, many measured in millions of lines of code, and will share my insights for coping with inpenetrable programs, how to gain confidence in the code before making changes and strategies for refactoring into a better state for the future. 

None of this should involve any snakes.
