# Throw me the Idol

Finding yourself in a situation where you need to make sense of, and maybe maintain, someone else's code is often said to be like gardening or, in extreme cases, archaeology. The code needn't been an old legacy system filled with ancient secrets and artifacts, it could be the newest piece of JavaScript framework wonderfulness from another team or a proof-of-concept sketch you now have to make production-ready. 

If you ever find yourself Indiana-Jonesing it through this kind of code what strategies and techniques can you use to stay ahead of the boulders and out of the clutches of the Nazis? 

Having inherited more than my fair share of nightmare code bases through my career, many measured in millions of lines of code, I will share my insights for coping with impenetrable programs, how to gain confidence in the code before making changes and strategies for refactoring into a better, cleaner state for the future. 

Unless things go terribly wrong, none of this should involve any snakes.
